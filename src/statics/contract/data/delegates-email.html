The following was sent as an e-mail to CTU delegates:

We hope you are staying informed and connected during this time. We want to provide some guidance and support for managing staff and student concerns.

We also know that as staff, you are part of a greater community, and families may be reaching out to you. Most important is to stay calm, healthy and safe. This, too, shall pass. When it is does, we want members to feel united and supported. <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/campaigns/right-to-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also important is the need to recover from this crisis and rebuild our communities</a>. As we manage our day-to-day, remember how our demands for more nurses, more resources and clean schools have preceded the COVID-19 pandemic. No one predicted this, but now that it is here, it is a reminder that what we fight for is important, and the issues we raise have relevance far beyond our classrooms.

<h2>Ways to communicate</h2>
Since we are all confined to our homes, there are a number of tools that make it easy for Professional Problems Committees (PPCs), Contract Action Teams (CATs) and school committees to communicate. Email, Zoom, texting apps like WhatsApp, Remind and Signal, and good old-fashioned phone calls are the way to go.

If you have questions, you should continue to use your PPC and CAT to communicate internally and see if the issue is isolated or deeply felt. You should also stay in touch about work updates and responsibilities, and use CPS-approved vendors for student and parent interaction in your work functions. For union organizing, however, <em>do not use CPS platforms; do use the personal communication tools</em> that are best for members of your school communities and functional groups.

<h2>This is a time to connect</h2>
Don’t keep to yourself! Some teams have met virtually to address questions, and discuss how to check in with and take care of each other while working from home. Delegates and CATs should be reaching out to fellow members to make sure they are healthy, have what they need and provide moral support. Now is the time to use your phone trees to make sure you’re all connected, and understanding that your members may be experiencing different reactions to this crisis.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Survey: Organizing during COVID-19 isolation</h2>
Please fill out the survey sent to delegates in Tuesday&rsquo;s e-mail to help us have a more detailed view of particular issues of concern, as well as the strength of our union, both as you work remotely and once we all return to schools.

<h2>Professional Problems Committee Professional Personnel Leadership Committee (PPLC) Contract Action Team</h2>
These teams should begin to reconstitute and move their work to electronic means (email threads, voice/video conferences) to solicit concerns from members about workload and other school issues. Work together to collectively communicate with administrators in a courteous and professional manner to ask for clarity on policy, and to advocate on behalf of members. If a directive from administration seems overly onerous, PPCs or CATs could email them asking, “What will happen if we are unable to comply?” or “How is this aligned to the CPS district guidance that we received by email, as we do not see this included?”

If administrators are threatening discipline, PPC members and CATs can help email or speak up on conference calls on behalf of individuals or groups impacted. Together, you can say and do your best to comply, but communicate if you are unable. If members have questions about policies, discuss possible solutions as a group via your text threads, phone trees, email threads or other discussion spaces. Be professional, as it is always possible that your communication could be shared with administrators.

<em>Always err on the side of engaging members rather than dealing with issues in isolation</em>. Let your principal know that decisions should be made together. Effectively and courteously use contract language or propose alternate solutions. For example, PPLCs can meet to discuss what they want to see in next year's budget. Bilingual teachers can prepare to order culturally relevant curriculum, given new wins in our contract.
<h2>Email and social media</h2>
Check your CPS and CTU emails for any updates or information from staff or the Union.  <em>Communicate with administration through your PPC and CATs on your CPS email. Use your personal email lists for union organizing</em>. Brainstorm a plan for members to update parents of changes, meal distribution or technology distribution at your school, or to find out what needs parents are having in regards to insurance, <a href="https://www.ctulocal1.org/posts/resources-for-stls-families/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">housing</a> or food. Use the school's website, robo-calls,  social media, etc. to share those updates.

Many members are using the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/CTUmembersonly/">CTU members only Facebook group</a> to discuss issues across our city and boost collective morale. We can also use social media as an opportunity for mutual aid (e.g. if one family needs a ride to get groceries, and another family can do it in exchange for a meal). A younger adult may have some time off work and can help an older adult who needs a ride to the doctor, or help talking to the insurance company. Create Google docs that can be shared in school communities.
